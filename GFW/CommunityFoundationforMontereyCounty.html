<h1>Community Foundation for Monterey County</h1>
Recently, GFW was awarded a two-year grant in support of the services we offer to homeless women on the Monterey Peninsula. Michael Reid and Kathy Whilden from the Fund for Homeless Women stopped by a recent luncheon to celebrate the grant with our Director of Operations Cindy Storrs.

The Fund for Homeless Women is a field of interest fund at the Community Foundation for Monterey County that was established to address the noticeable increase in homeless women on the Monterey Peninsula.

Thank you so much CFMC-FHW!
