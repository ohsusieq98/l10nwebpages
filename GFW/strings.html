<h2>Who We Are</h2>
Gathering for Women is a refuge for homeless women on the Monterey Peninsula. We provide services designed to reduce immediate harm and help homeless women transition out of homelessness, such as clothing, personal care items, case management, comprehensive resource support, limited emergency assistance, education to promote their health and safety, and connections to community service providers.
<h2>Our Goal</h2>
To provide the resources that will promote health, safety, and housing readiness among our women guests. Our hope is that every homeless woman will eventually be housed with appropriate supportive services.
